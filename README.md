# Simple Flash Card App

A simple flash card app that allows teams to centralize their flash cards and study with them.

## How To Use

1. Edit the `cardList` inside of `cards.ts`. Add elements to the array in the shape of a `FlashCard` **IT IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED AT THIS TIME TO ADD BOTH A SUBJECT AND A AUTHOR TO EVERY CARD**

2. run the project locally `yarn && yarn dev`

3. Filter the cards you want to study. A new quiz is defaulted to all cards.

4. Once your flash cards are selected hit `Start Quiz` and begin using your flash cards.
5. You can mark questions, correct, incorrect, and skip them. In the sidebar you can click on circles to jump directly to a previous question.
